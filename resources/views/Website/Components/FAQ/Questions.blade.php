                        <p class="p1"><a class="same_style" href="">Transfer</a> allows you to move data in bulk from one app to another. You can pick-and-choose which data to move and transfer it to any of LightNit's 3,000+ integrations.</p>
                        <p class="p2">A task is counted every time a Zap successfully moves data or takes action for you. For example, if your Transfer has an action to create new Google Contacts, each contact that is created will only use one task. That batch of 100 records will count as 100 tasks in your account billing.</p>

                        <p class="p2">The number of tasks you need depends on the number of active Zaps you have and how frequently those Zaps will run to automate your workflow. Don’t worry, if you use up all your tasks in a given month we’ll hold your tasks until you upgrade or your monthly usage resets. If you use more than 2 million tasks, you will be billed at a per-task rate of $0.001 USD.</p>
